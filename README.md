The purpose of this program is to identify the range of years present in a CSV dataset by locating columns that represent year values. It helps summarize the temporal coverage of the data without modifying the dataset.
The program takes a CSV file path as input and scans the file for columns whose names indicate they contain year information, then extracts valid year values from each row. It outputs the minimum year, maximum year, the count of unique years, and a sorted list of all years found by printing them to the console.
The program is run as a Python script that calls a main function to open the CSV file, validate and convert year values, and store them in a set for analysis. The code is structured with helper functions for data cleaning and a main execution block, making the logic clear, reusable, and easy to apply to similar datasets.
